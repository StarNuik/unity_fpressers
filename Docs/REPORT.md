# What I learned

bt compression on nginx - a big no
nav agent fps movement - a big yes
global objects are still a r bad idea (SOs, ShaderSauceController)
timeline wants a reference - make a MB service, specifically for timelines
profiling webgl - impossible? (firefox + nsight graphics)
services - are still great
